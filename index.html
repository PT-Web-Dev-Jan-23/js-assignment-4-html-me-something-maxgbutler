            <h2 class="header">The First &#119964;nimals in Space</h2>

            <div class="text-container">
               <p class="text">The first living creatures intentionally sent into space were fruit flies. These were transported aboard a V2 rocket on February 20th, 1947.</p> 
               <p class="text">The fruit flies were launched from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico as part of a research mission. The unnamed rocket travelled 67 miles into the air before parachuting back to Earth. NASA currently recognises the altitude of 66 miles (100km) as the point where space officially begins. Therefore, the fruit flies are considered the first animals ever to reach the final frontier.</p>
               <p class="text">The flies were the perfect passengers for the flight as their compact size, and relatively light weight made their storage easy and conserved on fuel consumption. At the time, little was known as to the effects of cosmic radiation on organic matter. As fruit flies have a similar genetic make-up to humans, they were seen as an eligible subject for testing and research. On the safe recovery of the flies' capsule, the scientists found that the flies' genetics had not been mutated by the radiation, which paved the way for future human spaceflight. </p>

            <h2 class="header">The First Mammals in Space</h2>

            <div class="text-container">
               <p class="text">On June 11th, 1948, the same V-2 rocket that Launched the fruit flies into space was used to carry Albert I, a Rhesus monkey, out of the Earths atmosphere. Unfortunately Ablert died of suffocation on his way up and never actually made it to space alive. One year later the U.S. decided to try again with another monekey, Albert II, attaining an altitude of 83 miles (that means he made it to space!). However the parachute for the capsule failed and Albert II died on impact. It took a few more tires but Eventrually the U.S. were able to recover Albert VI from his capsule alive.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 25px; margin-left: 50px;">Laika</h3>

            <div class="text-container">
               <p class="text">Laika was a young, part-Samoyed terrier found as a stray in Moscow. She was chosen as the Soviet scientists believed a homeless animal would be better equipped to endure the cold, hunger and harsh conditions of space travel. However, with inadequate oxygen and food supplies, Laika's death in space was expected from the outset of the mission. </p>
               <p class="text">In their training before the launch, the canine candidates were placed in a series of demanding endurance trials and medical examinations. Among other tests, scientists examined how the animals would cope in the distressingly cramped space capsule. Laika and two other dogs (Albina and Mushka) were placed in increasingly smaller cages over several weeks. With her calm temperament and grace under pressure, Laika was chosen. Vladimir Yazdovsky, the leader of the Soviet space mission, described Laika as “quiet and charming.”</p>
               <p class="text">There are conflicting accounts of Laika's death in space. The Soviet Union initially suggested she had died when the oxygen levels depleted or that she had been deliberately 'put to sleep' with poisoned food. In 1999 several Russian sources (such as the scientists involved in the space programme) stated that Laika had died on the fourth orbit of the Earth after a failure in Sputnik 2's temperature controls. On 14 April 1958 (after approximately 2,570 orbits), Sputnik 2 and Laika's remains left orbit and disintegrated on re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. </p>

            <h2 class="header">The First Animals to Orbit the Moon</h2>
            <div class="text-container">
               <p id="testp" class="funParagraph">The first animals to orbit the moon and return to Earth were two Russian tortoises aboard Zond 5. On 15 September 1968, the tortoises were launched with plants, seeds and bacteria around the moon and returned to Earth seven days later. The capsule and its occupants survived reentry. </p>

            <div class="text-container">
               <p class="text">As well as the fruit flies and Laika, since the 1940s, a variety of animals have been sent into space including ants, cats, frogs, and even jellyfish. </p>
               <p class="text">On 31 January 1961, the first hominid was launched into space. A chimpanzee named Ham was part of the US-led Mercury space programme. A main part of the mission was to test whether tasks could be performed in space, the results of which were instrumental when launching the first American in space, Alan Shepard, on 5 May 1961. </p>
               <p class="text">The French sent their first animal, a cat, into space on 18 October 1963. Félicette, a Felix cat, had electrodes implanted in her head to transmit her condition as she spent 5 minutes in weightlessness. She reached an altitude of 100 miles and landed safely but was killed two months later so that scientists could examine her brain.</p>
